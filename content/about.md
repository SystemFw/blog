Hi, I'm Fabio. I'm a Principal Software Engineer at Ovo Energy in London, specialised in distributed systems and purely functional programming.

I'm also an Open Source author and speaker as SystemFw: I'm one of the maintainers of fs2, cats-effect, and http4s, and a contributor to cats, shapeless and several other libraries in the Scala FP ecosystem.

This blog contains articles about purely functional programming in Scala and Haskell, and links to my conference talks. Reach me on Gitter, Github or Linkedin.

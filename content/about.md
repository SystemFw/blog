Hi, I'm Fabio. I'm a Principal Distributed Systems Engineer at [Unison
Computing](https://www.unison-lang.org/learn/the-big-idea/),
researching and implementing a programming model to express
distributed systems in our futuristic programming language and cloud
platform.


I'm also an Open Source author and speaker as SystemFw: I'm a core
contributor and maintainer of cats-effect, fs2, and several other
libraries in the Scala FP ecosystem.

This blog contains articles about purely functional programming and
concurrency, and links to my conference talks. Reach me on
[Github](https://github.com/SystemFw) or

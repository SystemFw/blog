Two meanings of simplicity:
compositional, easy to understand because each part does one isolated, fully contained thing.
minimal, where a part covers multiple purposes, but not in a complex way, where it has multiple facets of functionality, but rather in one functionality it covers multiple purposes.
The second type of simplicity is actually very hard to understand, because you cannot decompose it. However it has the least number of moving parts.

Need to find good examples.

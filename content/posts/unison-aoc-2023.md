I have solved the first 15 days of [Advent of Code
2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) in
[Unison](https://www.unison-lang.org/), and posted detailed writeups
on Unison Share, our beautiful code and documentation hosting website.

If you are interested in Unison, algebraic effects, or general FP
problem solving techniques including parser combinators and
optimisation of recursive algorithms, check them out
[HERE](https://share.unison-lang.org/@systemfw/aoc-2023).
